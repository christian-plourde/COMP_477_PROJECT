Pacman3D with cloth simulation and Mocap

Controls : 
	
W-A-S-D Or Up-Left-Down-Right Arrow to control Pacman.
K to display the kinect window. 


Kinect :

If a kinect V2.0 is connected, then pacman will also be allowed to take input from it for his movement (even if the window is not being shown) To control Pacman with the kinect simply center your right hand with the middle of square and move that hand out of the circle in the direction you wish pacman to go in then return it to the center. the input is only taken once on exit of square and thus is mandatory to return back to square before another input is taken.

P.S. to use the kinect , the windows kinect SDK v2.0 is needed and must be dowloaded on a windows computer.
